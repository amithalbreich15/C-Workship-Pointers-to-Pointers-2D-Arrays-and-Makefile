# Pointers-to-Pointers-2D-Arrays-and-Makefile
This project involves implementing a C library to support advanced operations on two-dimensional arrays (matrices) of type double. The library focuses on both functionality and efficiency, allowing the creation of matrices, concatenation by rows/columns, element access by indices, slicing submatrices, and more.
